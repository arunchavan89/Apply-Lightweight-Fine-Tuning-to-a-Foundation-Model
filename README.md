# Apply-Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model

Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.

In this Udacity project, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library is applied.
