# Apply-Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model

* Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.

* In this Udacity project, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library is applied.

# Project Summary
In this project, all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process are implemeted together. The steps are as the following:

* Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
* Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
* Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
